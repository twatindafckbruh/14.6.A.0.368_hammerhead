# 14.6.A.0.368_hammerhead
Sony 14.6.A.0.368 port to the beloved Nexus 5


What works now :

  - Nothing, as the ROM is from Z1.

What doesn't works now :
  - Everything. The initial commit (Stock Xperia Z1 14.6.A.0.368, Nexus 5 edited kernel and META-INF) only contains
    stock Xperia Z1 Global-LTE 14.6.A.0.368 ROM, and boot.img with Xperia Z1 stock BOOTCLASSPATH and SELinux contexts.
