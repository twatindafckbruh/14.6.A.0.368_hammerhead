# Script to create symlinks depending on currently active configuration
#
# A note on context: this script is only used when multiple CDFs are used. If a
# single CDF is used, the system image is already customized.
#
# This script is part of a customization scheme where certain files on /system
# may be replaced by symlinks on /data. Depending on active customization, the
# symlinks in /data may be rewritten to point to the corresponding actual files,
# effectively replacing the contents of files without write access to /system.
#
# During composition, if multiple CDFs are used, and at least one CDF provides a
# customized version of a file <F>:
#     - that file will be replaced by (dangling) symlink to
#       /data/customization/settings/<F>
#     - the original contents of that file will be placed in
#       /system/etc/customization/settings/defaults/<F>
#     - the customized versions of that file will be placed in
#       /system/etc/customization/settings/<id>/<F>, for all relevant <id>s
#
# Conversely, if none of the CDFs provide a customized version of a file, that
# file is kept as a regular file in its original place.
#
# This script provides the other half of the implementation. Triggered during
# boot by init.rc, the script creates the missing symlinks in
# /data/customization, which will point to
# /system/etc/customization/settings/defaults or
# /system/etc/customization/settings/<id>.
#
# Summary of related files:
#     Customized versions:
#         /system/etc/customization/settings/<id_1>/...
#         /system/etc/customization/settings/<id_2>/...
#         ...
#         /system/etc/customization/settings/<id_n>/...
#         /system/etc/customization/settings/defaults/...
#
#     Original file paths:
#         /etc/gps.conf
#         ...
#
#     Directory to hold symlinks (must be on writeable media):
#         /data/customization/
#
# Example result:
# /etc/gps.conf ->
#     /data/customization/gps.conf ->
#     /system/etc/customization/settings/1234-1234/gps.conf

# List of files that may be customized.
# Remember to add a trailing whitespace when adding new entries.
